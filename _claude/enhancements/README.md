# Enhancements Planning

This directory contains planning documents for future features and improvements. It serves as a place to draft enhancement ideas before executing them.

## Purpose

Enhancement planning documents provide detailed specifications, design considerations, and implementation approaches for future improvements. They help plan and design features before implementation begins.

## File Structure

Each enhancement file (YYYY-MM-DD_[feature]_plan.md) includes:

- Objective and motivation for the enhancement
- Current problem or limitation being addressed
- Planning approach and design considerations
- Proposed implementation strategy
- Technical specifications
- Potential challenges and mitigation approaches
- Success criteria and expected outcomes
- Future considerations and next steps

## When to Create Enhancement Planning Documents

Create enhancement planning documents when:

- Designing a significant new feature
- Planning substantial improvements to existing functionality
- Considering performance optimizations
- Planning a component or subsystem redesign
- Proposing a strategic architectural change

## Usage

Use these documents to:

- Plan feature development before writing code
- Design solutions to identified problems
- Think through implementation approaches
- Document design decisions before implementation
- Create a roadmap for future development
