# Runs Documentation

This directory contains detailed application execution logs from when the engine is run.

## Purpose

The runs directory provides logs of actual application executions, including configuration parameters, processing results, error information, and performance metrics. It stores the real runtime data and logs generated when the system is operating.

## File Naming Convention

Run logs follow this naming pattern: `run_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS_[identifier].txt`

For example: `run_2025-03-21_153825_initial_setup.txt`

## Log Contents

Each run log includes:

- Complete logs of program executions
- Configuration parameters used
- Processing results and statistics
- Error information and warnings
- Performance metrics and timing information
- Processing details

## Usage

Consult these logs to understand:

- How the application behaves during actual execution
- Performance characteristics under various real-world conditions
- Common errors encountered during operation
- Processing patterns and bottlenecks
- Historical execution results for comparison

These logs are valuable for diagnosing issues that occur during actual operation and for optimizing performance based on real-world usage patterns.
