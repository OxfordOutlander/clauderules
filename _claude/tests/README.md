# Tests Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive test scripts and associated test data. It includes scripts used to validate functionality of different components.

## Purpose

The tests directory provides scripts that test specific functions or components, along with the test data needed to run those tests. These files help understand how components are expected to behave and verify their functionality.

## Contents

- Test scripts with detailed docstrings and examples
- Test data files used by the scripts
- Test configuration files
- Test utility functions and helpers

## Test Structure

Each test script should include:

- Comprehensive documentation about what's being tested
- Prerequisites for running the test
- Setup and teardown procedures
- Test cases with expected outcomes
- Performance benchmarks where applicable

## Usage

Consult these files to understand:

- How different components are tested
- What validation methods are used
- Expected behavior of components
- What test data is available
- Performance characteristics
- Test coverage and potential gaps

These test scripts can be run to verify component functionality after changes.
