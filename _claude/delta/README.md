# Delta Records

This directory contains detailed records of changes made during implementation sessions.

## Purpose

Delta records document the specific changes made to the codebase during each implementation session, including what was modified, added, or removed. They provide a dy/dx of changes applied during a particular session.

## File Structure

Each delta file (YYYY-MM-DD_session_[identifier].md) documents:

- Date and session identifier
- Files modified, added, or removed
- Functions modified, added, or removed with signature details
- API changes with before/after code examples
- Database schema changes
- Brief explanation of the reason for each change
- Testing performed during the session

## When to Create a Delta Record

Create a delta record after each implementation session where code changes were made. This should be done at the end of the session to document what was changed during that specific session.

## Relationship to Enhancements

While enhancement documents in the enhancements/ directory are forward-looking planning documents, delta records are backward-looking and document what was actually implemented. They provide a record of the implementation journey.
