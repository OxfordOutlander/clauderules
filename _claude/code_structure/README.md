# Code Structure

This directory contains comprehensive information about code organization, relationships, and technical details. It combines code mapping and metadata to provide a complete picture of the codebase architecture.

## Purpose

The code structure documentation helps Claude understand the system architecture, component relationships, and implementation details. It maps function calls, module dependencies, and component interfaces.

## Files

- **function_calls.json**: Maps which functions call which others
- **module_structure.json**: Documents module relationships and dependencies
- **component_graph.json**: Dependency graph of components
- **file_classification.json**: Categorization of files by type and purpose
- **[component_name].md**: Detailed documentation for specific components

## Usage

Consult these files to understand:

- Function call hierarchies
- Module dependencies
- Component relationships
- Technical specifications for each component
- Performance characteristics
- Integration points
- Configuration options

This information helps Claude understand how changes in one part of the code might affect others and how the system components work together.
