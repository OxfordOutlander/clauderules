# Implementation Patterns

This directory documents standard implementation patterns used throughout the codebase. Each pattern includes a detailed explanation, code examples, and guidance on when to use it.

## Purpose

These pattern libraries help maintain consistency across the codebase and provide guidance for implementing new features. They document established solutions to common problems.

## Pattern Categories

- Error handling patterns
- Data validation patterns
- State management patterns
- API interaction patterns
- Processing pipeline patterns

## File Structure

Each pattern file follows a consistent format:

1. Problem statement and context
2. Solution approach with diagrams
3. Implementation details with code examples
4. When to use and when not to use
5. Benefits, trade-offs, and limitations
6. Related patterns and alternatives
7. Real examples from the codebase
